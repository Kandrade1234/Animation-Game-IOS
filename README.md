# Animation-Game-NYAN CAT: Home Defender

Help defend Nyan cat's planet! On a cozy day, while eating breakfast, the evil cats decided to attack (the Nayn's). Can you help and fend them off from entering Nyan cat's planet?

The objective of this game is to protect your home planet. You play as the Nyan cat and shoot donuts at your enemies! but be careful! your planet only has 3 lives and if you let them reach your planet then you loose! Also, Nyan cat only has 1 life! but dont worry, as you kill more enemies you get a rapid shooting power-up....but with great power comes great responsibility.. as you power-up so do the enemies.

This game was made for IOS using swift and there were tons of techniques used in this program. There are animations, background music, sound effects, multiple scenes, buttons, collision detection multiple sprites...and much more. If you'd like to see this game in action give me a thumbs up! and you wont be disappointed
